# Schoolwork

## Descriptions

### BST (C++)
This lab implemented a binary search tree. After running 'make' and './Lab6' , the program creates a binary search tree using the data.txt file. You can then run different operations on it such as insert, delete, get in order successor, print level order, print spiral level order, and get k'th smallest item.

### CollisionResolutionTests (C++)
This lab implemented a two hash tables - one that resolved collisions using quadratic probing, and one that resolved collisions using double hashing. After running 'make' and './Lab5' , the program compares the build and find operations of the two implementations using different sized inputs. 

### GraphAndDisjointSets (C++)
This lab implemented a graph and disjoint sets (also contains files for creating a min heap). After running 'make' and './Lab10' , the program builds disjoint sets and a graph from data txt files. allows you to perform operations on the disjoint sets such as union, find, path compression, and print path. You can also perform operations on the graph such as BFS, DFS, compute Kruskal MST, and computer Prim MST. 

### vigenereCipher (Python)
This Python file implements a Vigenere Cipher - a simple polyalphabetic substitution algorithm. There is an encrypt feature that takes plaintext and a key and transforms it into ciphertext, and there is a decrypt feature that takes ciphertext, a key length, and a first word length (you're somewhat cheating here by assuming you know a key length and first word length) and decrypts the ciphertext.

### kMeanRestaurant
This was the capstone project for my IBM Data Science certificate. It uses Central LA neighborhood data, the Foursquare Places API, Python, and k means clustering to determine the best neighborhood to place a new pizza restaurant based on nearby venues, foot traffic, and neighborhood income.
